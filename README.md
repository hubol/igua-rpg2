# IguaRPG 2
### Another computer game of the ages
This is another fangame of [Oddwarg Animal RPG](http://oddwarg.com/index.php?id=OARPG), a Game Maker game from 2003.

## Using the source code
This is a modern web project. You will need `node` and `npm` to continue.

## smooch?
This project is in early stages of development. Eventually, I will be test-driving [smooch](https://github.com/hubol/smooch/tree/feature/v1) with it.
`smooch` will be used to generate code and engine-ready binary resources from assets like images and audio files.

<!-- You will need the Git LFS extension to correctly pull the project's FLAC and WAV files. -->
