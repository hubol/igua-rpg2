# IguaRPG 2
### Another computer game of the ages
This is another fangame of [Oddwarg Animal RPG](http://oddwarg.com/index.php?id=OARPG), a Game Maker game from 2003.

## Using the source code
This is a modern web project. You will need `node` and `npm` to continue.

You will need the Git LFS extension to correctly pull the project's asset files.

Certain asset and source code files are generated using `@hubol/smooch`.

## Play an alpha?!
You can play an extremely early version of the game. The most recent commit to the `main` branch of this repository is hosted on Heroku.
At the time of writing this, the "game" is mostly a sandbox for testing a revamped game engine.
